## Resource Collections
## Website
We are hosting a website through GitHub Pages: http://www.codingcurious.xyz/ (under construction)  

The idea is to develop it together collaboratively, maybe we can organize a little mini-hackaton to do it :)

## How to contribute

Any improvements, ideas, additions welcome, both in terms of content, and in terms of how to run this repository. 

If you would like to contribute, but are new to GitHub, here are some useful links:  
+ tutorial: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github 
+ a repository that guides you through making your first pull request: https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions  
+ introduction to open source: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/an-introduction-to-open-source 

If we have any expert members, a Git and GitHub tutorial would be a neat meetup topic - let us know if you'd like to hold a little workshop! :)


## Member Projects

If any of our members want to advertise their projects, this may be a good place to link them ;)
