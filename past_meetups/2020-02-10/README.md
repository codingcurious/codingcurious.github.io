# First Coffee With Coding Curious #

*Date:* February 10, 2010  
*Location:* Quahwa  
*Attendees:* 10  

Our first meetup was a casual introduction and chat, where we heard different paths people have taken in their learning journey.  

## So, who attended? ##

Overall a very interesting and colorful group of individuals. We had not one, but *two* forrestry engineers, several economists, and a combination of transportation engineers, journalists, fitness trainers, entrepreneurs, and even - believe it or not - software engineers. Some are just starting, some are already working as programmers, and some already have decades of experience. But all with one thing in common - always learning and wanting to learn more.  

## How are people learning? ##

1. **Online resources**

Free and easy introductions for complete beginners were mentioned:   
  * [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)  
  * [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) (Python was mentioned, there's other languages also. Some content free, some paid)  
  * Youtube tutorials (no concrete courses were mentioned, but if you have some you really enjoyed, please do share)  
  * [Harward's Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/) (this one is not the easiest introduction course, but it's worth it based on the stellar reviews it gets)  
         - first lesson of CS50 includes intro to the playful [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) platform by MIT
  * [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) (a collection of free online books and videos for those who are interested in a broader computer science knowledge base than pure programming)  


Not free, but often very cheap:  
  * [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) (courses often availabe on discount for $10)  
         There is a lot of stuff on Udemy, and sometimes hard to pick the right course. If in doubt, the attendees warmly recommended courses by [Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/user/coltsteele/).  


Paid subcriptions to level up (often employers have subcriptions to these):  
  * [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) (sometimes have free weekend promotions, professional developers swear by the quality of these videos)  
  * [FrontendMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/) (special recommendation for courses by Will Sentance - some of his talks also available on YouTube)  


Online bootcamps and degrees:
  * [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) (An online fullstack development bootcamp)
  * [Online University Degree in Computer Science](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/computer-science) (Coursera offers online courses and degrees in partnership with universities, both bachelors and masters options exist). 

2. **In-person educations**

Some bootcamps and short courses are also available in Zagreb. We had attendees who tried:  
  * [Algebra](https://www.algebra.hr/certifikacijski-seminari/) (apart from their degree programs, Algebra also has shorter certification courses in Zagreb)  
  * [Smart Ninja](https://www.smartninja.hr/) (coding bootcamp in Zagreb)  


Or bootcamps abroad?  
  * [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/) (Le Wagon offers immersive fullstack bootcamps in many European cities, if you are not tied to Zagreb)  


Sponsored incubators
  * [Pismo](http://inkubator-pismo.eu/) (In Novska, incubator for learning how to program computer games)
  * Some employer-sponsored incubators exist. If any concrete examples, please share, otherwise keep an eye out! 


3. **Learning on the job**

There's no learning like learning on the job. Often we do not get to pick our first job, but discussed differences between experiences in startups and larger companies.  

In a startup you are more likely to have to figure things out on your own, and be directly thrown into the deep end of the pool. With the help of good team leads and colleagues, and most importantly, the internet - it may be a bit chaotic, but a very steep learning curve. No pain, no gain :) Being less formal than larger companies, startups are where you may find your first job opportunity - take it and run with it!  

In larger companies, things are more structured, you may get the opportunity to work with a mentor and learn from them. And then after you've worked on your first project, move to a different one, with a different technology. Use your mentor wisely, it is an invaluable resource.  

4. **Learning by doing (your own projects)**

The advice we have heard over and over again from the experienced programmers in the group - find something you want to build, and build it. While tutorials are a good way to start, you are not a programmer until you have programmed something of your own, without following step-by-step guides. It may seem daunting, but this is the way to build your portfolio that you will show to your future employers.  

## What's next? ##

This repository will serve as a collection of notes, ideas, plans, for the group.  
The idea behind this group is for everyone who has an idea on how to make it useful - to implement the idea! Not every meetup will be interesting to everyone, but if you are interested in something, one thing is certain - there's at least a few other people who will be interested in that same thing. So reach out and find them here.  

+ *You have a book about programming you want to read, but would like to have people to discuss it with?* Suggest a bookclub meeting.  

+ *You have a topic you know about and want to speak about it?* Be a speaker at one of our meetups.  

+ *You are working on an app and would like some help or feedback?* We could organize show-and-tell sessions or hackathons.  

+ *You are taking an online course and want to find study buddies?* Check if anyone here would like to have study sessions with you.  

+ *There's a conference with online live stream you think would be interesting?* Let's organize a viewing.  

You know an organizations who'd like to sponsor a meetup session to promote their school/company? Send them our way.  

## Did I miss anything? ##

These notes, same as this whole repository is meant to be a collaborative effort. If you have anything to add or correct, join our repository and create issues / pull requests. If you have any advice for me, please feel free to openly let me know. I have not been running group repositories before, and I am sure I am doing many things all wrong - I'm very open to constructive feedback.  

Code, learn, have fun, and see you at our next meetup!
